    b. went to user pool in aws. looked for app clients -> domain -> 
    cognito domain. copied this and pasted on my FE env. --> look at : AWS Domain.png

    c. went to user pool > Social and external providers and added google. look at 
    external providers.png. look at

    Allowed callback URLs: https://d84fl1y8p4kdic.cloudfront.net,http://localhost:3000/

    Allowed sign-out URLs: http://localhost:3000/

    debug : 1. this should match aws config in google signin option

              domain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_COGNITO_DOMAIN!,
              scopes: ["openid", "email", "profile"],
              redirectSignIn: ["http://localhost:3000/"],

              responseType: "code",
              providers: ["Google"],

            2. look at debug.png to make sure email openid and profile is there also.

            3. MAINDEBUG1.png -> have to set google as identity providers
